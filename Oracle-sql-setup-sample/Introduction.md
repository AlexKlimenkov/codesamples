Barry Brierley has kindly shared the following example of using the Teamwork Projects API with Oracle SQL

Attached is some sample code for creating the neccessary package and the tables.

In this example, it creates a schema called “apex_ebs_extension” which you can change to suit your needs.

There is a settings table which stores the account details, and other settings which are used by an Apex 5.0 App.

This example is getting only the basic information and any column can be added by adding columns to the relevant tables and changing the cursor in each procedure.

This code will get Teamwork Projects data into an Oracle database.
